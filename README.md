# Cryptocurrencies

## Challenge Overview
The premise of the challenge was to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for Accountability Accounting's new investment portfolio for its customers. In order to accomplish this, unsupervised machine learning was used along with the crypto_data.csv file and the 'crypto clustering' starter code provided.
